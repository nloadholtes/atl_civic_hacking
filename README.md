The Center for Civic Innovation hosted a "Food security" hackathon. Participants were told about some challenges in getting food to people, and then invited to explore several options.

This repo is for the code I made there to try and do some analysis on some EBT/SNAP/WIC data realting to Farmer's Markets.

Farmer's Markets are an interesting option in food: They are typically stocked with locally grown foods, are typically community centric/oriented, and some vendors accept EBT/SNAP/WIC.

One of the challenges with programs like SNAP is not only getting people connected with food, but also ensuring that they have access to healthy choices, not just what's convenient (such as fast foods).

A Farmer's Market presents an interesting solution: Healthy foods, local community support, and a place where EBT/SNAP/WIC is accepted.
